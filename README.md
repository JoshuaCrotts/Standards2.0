# Standards2.0

This Standards 2.0 library is the extension from Standards, and it has six main packages contributed by Joshua Crotts and Andrew Matzureff: Commands, Constants, Input, Standards, Interactors (most likely void in future), and tests. All of these java files are used in conjunction to create one gigantic library so one does not have to fiddle with all of the backend supplements when making a game in Java; it is all created here for them. All one has to do is extend StandardGameObject, and begin drawing tickable object and rendering them in the appropriate tick() and render() methods. Everything with BufferStrategies and updating is all done in the background, same goes for the imperative game loop. This library, like stated, derives from the original Standards library which had a bunch of issues, and even required the user to type out the BufferStrategy information, and even copy and paste the game loop originally. Since that version, this one has been cleaned up, altered, and fixed altogether. Simply import the Standards2.0 JAR into the Java Build Path of your project and you're good to go.
